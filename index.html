                Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu,(26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), better known as Mother Teresa (Albanian: Nënë
                Tereza), was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun who, in 1950, founded the Missionaries of Charity. Anjezë
                Gonxhe Bojaxhiu (pronounced [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒiu]) was born in Skopje—at the time, part of the
                Ottoman Empire.[a] After eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived most of
                her life. Saint Teresa of Calcutta was canonised on 4 September 2016. The anniversary of her death is
                her feast day.

                After Mother Teresa founded her religious congregation, it grew to have over 4,500 nuns and was active
                in 133 countries as of 2012. The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS,
                leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics,
                children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of
                chastity, poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to
                the poorest of the poor".
